# 100 Days of Machine Learning and Data Science

100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell)

Plan to code or study machine learning/data science for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days.
Make a public log of work, weekly on [Github](https://github.com/harshbg/100-Days-of-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science) and daily on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harshbg/status/1039606832044625921).
